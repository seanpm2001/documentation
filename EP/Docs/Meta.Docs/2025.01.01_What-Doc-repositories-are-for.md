## What documentation repositories are for

### What doc repositories are for

- General and extended documentation for projects
- Manual pages

### What Wiki repositories are for

Wiki page archives

### Why not merge the two?

Wiki pages are for development, while documentation pages are for the final copy. This practice is going obsolete, as updates are just being made to the documentation repositories. New Wiki repositories are created rarely, so the process is already in decline. Existing Wiki repositories are being kept for historical purposes.
