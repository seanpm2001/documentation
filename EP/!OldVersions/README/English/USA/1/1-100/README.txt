# New EP process

On 2025, Wednesday, January 1st, I decided to create an Enhancement Proposal (EP) area for my core documentation repository, so that ideas can be brought together. I feel that in 2025, I can bring this repository up to code, to the point where it will be useful and functional again, if not at least attempt to do this.
